This is a gradle project to write and compile the ASCIIDOCTOR files to generate HTML, PDF, DocBook & epub3 backends for my personal book of all I learn as a developer.
Ths _src/main/docs/asciidoc_ folder contains the book sources.

NOTE: You must have Java 8 installed, ASCIIDOCTOR with the gradle plugin. Thus, in order to use this document generator 
refer to the usage section below.
 
== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to HTML, PDF, DocBook & epub3 by invoking the 'asciidoctor' goal:

 $ ./gradlew asciidoc
